# DarthBot
DarthBot is a discord bot I created leading off my work on the Retali8 Bot. It has all the standard features such as moderation, music etc along side a Clans and Economy System. I make this open source in the hope that others can learn from it. I don't claim that the code is anywhere near perfect as this was a huge learning curve for me, and I advanced my knowledge of Java as I created it.

If you find the code useful and want to buy me a coffee, feel free to donate a quid here >> https://www.paypal.me/sirdarth

p.s. All bot tokens have been reset and all passwords changed for security purposes
